# Model architecture.
# Traversal order within any single depth level (BFS-inferred) is user determined.
# For example, if OSN->PG, OSN->ET, and PG->ET, then PG and ET are both d=1 away from the root (OSN).
# If PG precedes ET on the ensemble/synapse lists below, traversal order will be [OSN, PG, ET, ...].
