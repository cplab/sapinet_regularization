  sweep:
    # this singleton layer produces a 40Hz gamma oscillation.
    fixed:
      amplitudes: [1.0]
      # frequency combinations going into each oscillator unit.
      frequencies: [20.0]
      # phase shifts for each frequency component, to be multiplied by np.pi (all zeros by default).
      phases: [0.0]
      # this is, implicitly, a prior on the working range of your sensors/features (i.e., "the lowest k% is noise").
      # baseline shift > amplitude will soft-threshold weak signals by drowning them out of the permissive window.
      # baseline shift = amplitude will allow the weakest signal to express itself at the very trough.
      # baseline shift < amplitude will make gamma excitatory around the trough.
      baseline_shift: 1.0
