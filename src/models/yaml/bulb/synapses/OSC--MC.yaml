  sweep:
    fixed:
      # larger weights tighten the permissive window for MCs by pulling up the inhibitory oscillation amplitude.
      # for expected behavior, should be set to -1 / (min_resolution * payload).
      # 'min_resolution' is the minimal analog value that the spiking layer should be able to represent.
      # 'payload' is the current required to fire a spiking unit (e.g., 10).
