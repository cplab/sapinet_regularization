  # in baseline mode, when not set to false, all weights are set to this value (homogeneous duplication).
  baseline: false

  # in the heterogeneous modes, user may choose equidistant weights or ~ 1/x weights.
  # the former corresponds to an exponential prior on the input, the latter to a uniform prior.
  uniform: true

  # in the adaptive heterogeneous mode, weight densities are determined based on a calibration set.
  adaptive: false
  smoothing: -1   # bias-variance lever for weight density interpolation, from 0 (jagged) to 1 (smooth).

  # current required to fire an average LIF unit in the destination ensemble.
  payload: 25.0

  # analog value that would activate exactly one MC per column, given the above payload.
  # used to compute an appropriate multiplicative gain factor for the heterogeneous weights.
  # if adjusted via multiplication, the OSC->MC weight (gamma amplitude) should be multiplied by the same factor.
  limit: .01
